# Note Taker App

## Description

This application allows the user to write, save, and delete text notes. When saved, the note is added to a backend json file and will be added to the past notes column on the left side of the screen. It will also automatically load on page load. And when deleted the note is removed from the json file. 

Coding the backend of this application taught me a lot about routes (especially delete and post) and how to line up the backend with the frontend to create a fully functional app. 


## Installation
